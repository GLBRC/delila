Set up
------

    Prior to running delila you will need to define the script directory by editing the
    scriptDir varible in the delila_pipeline.py file.

    scriptDir = '/home/<userName>/bin/delila/' or wherever it is located.

    Script assumes ps2pdf is installed

Compile C code
--------------

    The Delila programs can be automatically translated from Pascal to C using
    David Gillespie's p2c translater. The resulting c code can be compiled by the gcc compiler.
    This was done for the following programs: 
    
    alist
    catal
    comp
    dalvec
    dbbk
    delila
    encode
    makelogo
    malign
    malin 
    mkdb
    ri
    rseq

    See  http://users.fred.net/tds/lab/pascalp2c.html for original help,  
    instructions below are adapted from those instructions.


    1) You will need to get the libraries from the p2c package and compile them on your machine.
       Note the installation directory as you will need the p2c.h file for use with the -I flag
       for gcc, and several of the lib files for the -L/usr/local/lib flag for gcc, see command below.

    make sure to change the path in the following header in the c code:

    #include </home/<userName/bin/p2c/src/p2c.h>

    Then run the Makefile in the src directory.

    cd src
    make

    This code has been compiled with gcc 7.5.0 (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04), but any 
    relatively recent gcc compiler should work.

    To compile individual files, here is an example with dbbk.c: 

    gcc  dbbk.c -o dbbk  -I/home/<userName>/bin/p2c/src -L /home/<userName>/bin/p2c/src -lm -lp2c
    
To translate (Pascal to C)
--------------------------

    The original delila Pascal code is available here : users.fred.net/tds/lab/delila.html

    Obtain the current version of p2c from  
    (https://github.com/FranklinChen/p2c) or 
    (https://www.gsp.com/cgi-bin/man.cgi?section=1&topic=p2c)

    You will need three files:

    include file: p2c.h
    pascal library: p2clib.c
    control file: .p2crc In your home directory (Linux operating system) you will need to have a
                control file for p2c (it's called .p2crc) with following lines:
    
        LiteralFiles 2
        NestedComments 2
        StructFiles 1

    You may get a warning about "SYSTEM" which you can ignore.
