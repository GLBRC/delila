Delila Docker Image
------------
    A Delila Docker image has been created for cross-platform use.
    
    Delila Docker image:  https://hub.docker.com/r/glbrc/delila

    1) Install Docker

        https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

        Test your Docker installation:

        `sudo docker run hello-world`

        You should see something like:

        Hello from Docker!
        This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly 
        ...

    2) Pull Docker image:

        `sudo docker pull glbrc/delila`

        You should see something like:

        Using default tag: latest
        latest: Pulling from glbrc/delila
        da7391352a9b: Pull complete 
        14428a6d4bcd: Pull complete 
        2c2d948710f2: Pull complete 
        6e574971b428: Pull complete 
        98ae9b1c7d2a: Pull complete 
        400a97ff91ed: Pull complete 
        Digest: sha256:f865911122576824ebe331d0faf8989a4371350db8a9ff4121f4fb9342b37ea2
        Status: Downloaded newer image for glbrc/delila:latest
        docker.io/glbrc/delila:latest

        CONCERNING SUDO:

        If you don't want to use sudo everytime you run docker, follow the instructions
        here: Linux post-installation setup, https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/,
        Note this has sercurity implications, you should be aware of: 
        https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface                          

    3) List Docker images to make sure it Delila was downloaded.

        `sudo docker images`
       glbrc/delila 
        REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
        glbrc/delila        latest              90845438bd28        6 days ago          620MB
        hello-world         latest              bf756fb1ae65        12 months ago       13.3kB

        You will see the hello-world image listed because you tested the docker install right!

    4) Run the Delila example (Highly Recommended)

        `sudo docker run -dit -P --name delila -v /home/user/test/delila/container-data:/opt/delila/example/container-data  glbrc/delila`
           
            -dit is `d` for detached mode,  `it` makes bash available in a pseudo terminal.
            -P reports ports to the host.
            â€“name give the container a name, (Optional)
            -v attach a volume for sharing data with host system

                the path prior to the ":" is the directory path on your host machine, where
                you can your delila input files, they will be visible in the container.
                In this case this is:
                
                    "/home/user/test/delila/container-data"  if this doesn't exit it will be created
                
                The second directory path (after the ":") is working directory within the 
                docker container, in this case: 
                
                    "/opt/delila/example/container-data"

            glbrc/delila is the image used for the container


        After running the docker run command you should see a container ID written in
        the terminal. It will look something like:

        22d098e7b4cacdc346f5cadaea561a0f2d9f7bcb1833b301c603c598b409a355

        check that the container is running:

        `sudo docker ps -a` 

        CONTAINER ID     IMAGE         COMMAND     CREATED          STATUS         PORTS   NAMES
        22d098e7b4ca   glbrc/delila   "/bin/bash"  42 seconds ago   Up 41 seconds          delila

        Access the container by running at least the first 4 characters of the Container ID:

        `sudo docker attach 22d098` 
        
            OR

        `sudo docker attach delila`
        
        You will see a command line prompt, something like:

        root@aaab660630ab:/#

        run `ls`  -- this will show the directory structure

        bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib32  lib64  libx32  media  mnt  opt ....

        `cd /opt/delila/example`
        
        Run Delila using the example files:

        ../delila_pipeline.py -g Rsphaeroides_GenBank.gbff -s Location_File_Example.txt  -l -10 -r +10
    
        This will produce the following files & directories:

        R.sphaeroides-2.4.1-initial.logo 
        delila_pipeline.log
        R.sphaeroides-2.4.1_PWM.txt
        R.sphaeroides-2.4.1-FINAL.logo
        R.sphaeroides-2.4.1-initial.logo.pdf
        R.sphaeroides-2.4.1-FINAL.logo.pdf
        directories:
        parameters/
        other/
        instructions/
        books/
   
       You may detach from a running container and leave it running by: 
       entering `^P^Q` and reattach with:

       `sudo docker start delila`   assuming you named the contain delila
       `sudo docker attach delila`

    5) To run your own data 

        Create a working directory for your data on the host system.
        
        mkdir mywork

        copy your delila input files into mywork/

        Start your delila container (detached mode)
        `sudo docker run -dit -P --name delila -v /home/user/test/mywork:/opt/delila/example/container-data  glbrc/delila`

        `sudo docker attach delila`

        ../delila_pipeline.py -g Rsphaeroides_GenBank.gbff -s Location_File_Example.txt  -l -10 -r +10


        The results file will be placed on the host system, in /home/user/test/mywork


Delila-PY
-----------
    Delila-PY is a pipeline to make it quick and easy to run various Delila software packages
    in order to construct a binding site logo.

    Delila-PY uses programs developed in the lab of Tom Schneider and more information can be
    found at his website:  http://users.fred.net/tds/lab/

    Delila-PY uses standard (often default) values and allows the user to quickly process a
    file consisting of genomic locations to identify a potential logo. To use the pipeline
    directly, a few steps are required before you can begin:

    	1) The script directory must be manually chaged within the program

        Define the script directory by editing the "scriptDir" varible in the delila_pipeline.py file.

        scriptDir = '/home/<userName>/bin/delila/' or wherever it is located.

    	2) The required programs must be compilied from Pascal to C:
    		- alist
    		- catal
    		- comp
    		- dalvec
    		- dbbk
    		- delila
    		- encode
    		- makelogo
    		- malign
    		- malin
    		- mkdb
    		- ri
    		- rseq
    	3) The required GenBank file must be downloaded from NCBI and the genomic location file
    	must be constructed as indicated below

    We have provided example files in the Git repository as a guide both to how to run the Delila-PY
    and the format of the required files. The example files represent genomic coordiates for binding
    sites of the transcription factor FnrL from the bacterium *Rhodobacter sphaeroides*.
    	- Location_File_Example.txt is the genmoic location example file
    	- Rsphaeroides_GenBank.gbff is the *R. sphaeroides* GenBank file from NCBI

    Script assumes ps2pdf is installed

Create logo
-----------

    You need to provide the following:

    1) genbank file for your genome of interest 
    2) sites file which is tab delimited with columns: 
        
        chromosome name : must match the chromosome names in genbank file
        name : unique identifier for site
        strand :  forward or reverse 
        position :  base pair position of site

    example:
    NC_007493.2   site_1   forward   409225

    where NC_007493.2 is a R.sphaeroides chromosome name
    site_1 is the name
    forward is the strand 
    409225 is the base position of the site

    To run delila and create a logo:

    delila_pipeline.py -g Rsphaeroides_GenBank.gbff -l -10 -r -10 -s Location_File_Example.txt
    
Running individual Delila programs
----------------------------------

    It is possible to run each C program on it's own outside of the pipeline.
    To show a program's help, just run the program without any parameters.
    This is not recommended as the pipeline aims to reduce the complexity of
    Delila programs.  If you desire to do this, read the help for each 
    program and refer to the original delila website for detailed information.

    Note only the following delila programs are available in this repository:
    
    alist, catal, comp, dalvec, dbbk, delila, encode,makelogo, malign, malin, mkdb, ri, rseq

Description of Delila programs and pipeline
-----------

    Create a sequence logo for user defined sites using the Delila package.
    Supports single or multiple chromosomes.
    
    Notes
    ----- 
    
    The programs used in this pipeline have been converted from Pascal to C, by
    Oliver Giramma.  They were then modified to use command line arguments.
    
    (From the Delila Documentation, http://users.fred.net/tds/lab/software.html)
    
    DELILA stands for DEoxyribnucleaic-acid LIbrary LAnguage.
    
    It is a language for extracting DNA fragments from a large collection of sequences,
    invented around 1980 (T. D. Schneider, G. D. Stormo, J. S. Haemer, and L. Gold", A
    design for computer nucleic-acid sequence storage, retrieval and manipulation, 
    Nucl. Acids Res., 10: 3013-3024, 1982). The idea is that there is a large database
    containing all the sequences one would like, which we call a `library'. 
    
    One would like a particular subset of these sequences, so one writes up some 
    instructions and gives them to the librarian, Delila, which returns a `book' 
    containing just the sequences one wants for a particular analysis. So `Delila' 
    also stands for the program that does the extraction (delila.p). Since it is 
    easier to manipulate Delila instructions than to edit DNA sequences, one makes
    fewer mistakes in generating one's data set for analysis, and they are trivial
    to correct. Also, a number of programs create instructions, which provides a 
    powerful means of sequence manipulation. One of Delila's strengths is that it
    can handle any continuous coordinate system. The `Delila system' refers to a 
    set of programs that use these sequence subsets for molecular information 
    theory analysis of binding sites and proteins. In the spring of 1999 Delila 
    became capable of making sequence mutations, which can be displayed graphically
    along with sequence walkers on a lister map. A complete definition for the
    language is available https://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/libdef.html, although not
    all of it is implemented. There are also tutorials on building Delila libraries
    and using Delila instructions. 
    
    Understanding Left and Right boundaries:
    Delila positioning, bounds will be set by LEFT and RIGHT.
    
    scenario 1:
    Left = -10 
    Right = +10 
    site example:
    Site position 100, then the bounds are Left = position 90, Right = position 110
    cmd: delila_pipeline.py -g genome.gbff -l -20 -r +10 -t sites_for_delila.txt
    
    scenario 2, looking for the -10 position upstream from a transcription start site position.
    Left = -20
    Right = 0
    site example:
    TSS at position 100,  Left = position 80, Right = position 100
    cmd: delila_pipeline.py -g enome.gbff -l -20 -r 0 -t sites_for_delila.txt
    
    
    scenario 3, looking for the -35 position upstream from a transcription start site
    Left = +5
    Right = +25
    site example:
    TSS at position 100, Left = position 105, Right = position 125
    
    Delila is a modular set of programs which produce results that feed into the next
    program.  It is highly configurable using parameter files.  The delila programs
    used are listed below with general descripbtions.
    
    Delila programs used to make logo (descriptions from the Delila documentation)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    dbbk: 
    Convert GenBank flat file format to Delila format, which is called a `book'
    (db = database, bk = book). This produces an 'l1' file which contains the book.
    (l1 is a lower case L [standing for 'Library'] followed by the symbol 'one').
    
    catal: 
    Catalogue the contents of a book, usually l1. If you are not using them
    (which is generally the case) make empty l2, l3 and catalp files, then run catal.
    This will produce six files: lib1, lib2, lib3 and cat1, cat2, cat3. These make 
    up the library used by Delila in the next step.
    
    delila:
    Extract fragments of sequences from a library of sequences and create 
    a subset, a book. This is the core of the Delila system. You give Delila 
    instructions (inst file) and those are used to create the subset desired. 
    For a logo, generally one makes instructions that look like this:
    
     get from 5600 -200 to same +200 direction +;
    
    This means to get 200 bases before position 5600 to 200 bases afterwards, 
    for a total of 401 bases. I recommend that you use a wide range like this to
    be able to see the background noise around the binding site. By the way, the 
    number 5600 becomes the zero coordinate of the binding site. I try to pick a
    position that is strongly conserved (high information content). 
 
    malign: 
    Given a book of aligned sequences, this program searches for the alignment
    of the sequences that has the lowest uncertainty, i.e. the highest value of
    Rsequence. The user specifies the "window" of bases within which
    uncertainty is calculated, and the maximum number of bases that each
    sequence is allowed to shift from the original alignment.  The program
    considers each sequence in turn, shifting it to an alignment with minimum
    uncertainty while holding the other sequences fixed.  A "pass" is complete
    when all sequences have been considered.  A "run" is complete when no
    alignments have changed in the preceding pass, and the alignment is then
    considered "optimal".  The first run starts with the original alignment;
    every run after that starts with a "shuffled" alignment obtained by shifting
    each sequence independently by a random amount between the allowed limits.
    The program maintains a list of all of the unique optimal alignments
    achieved from these starting alignments, and it outputs them in order of
    increasing uncertainty.
    
    malin:
    This program allows one to select one of the alignments created by malign
    and to make the corresponding Delila instructions.  Because it copies the
    inst file it keeps the organism and chromosome information (along with all
    comments) so it is better than the "bestinst" file created by malign!
    
    alist:
    Make an aligned listing of sequences using the Delila instructions 
    and the book created by Delila. The pair of the book and inst file is a set
    called an 'aligned book'. I create a listing of the sequences to be sure 
    that they are aligned correctly. If this works, making the logo is fast
    and a piece of cake.  Even if you have a large range defined in the delila
    instructions, you can use a smaller one for the aligned listing. Note that
    running this program does not affect the inst or book files, so can't
    affect later steps. The program is controled by a file `alistp', which 
    stands for alist-parameters. 

    encode:
    Convert the book/inst into 0 and 1's. This is historically the way
    we did it, but it is fast so we still do it this way. The output is encseq,
    which is a bit large. To save space, you can delete the encseq file after
    running the next program. Note that the range can be reduced in the
    parameter file, so I normally set this to -200 to 200.

    comp:
    Comp counts the number of each oligonucleotide (from length 1 to
    compmax) in the book and prints that to file "cmp".  The output is
    printed in order of increasing length of oligonucleotide (i.e., first
    the monos, then the dis, ...).  If there are no occurences of an
    oligonucleotide, but its one-shorter parent did occur, it will be given
    a zero.  None of its descendants will be printed in the composition
    file.

    rseq:
    Compute Rsequence for each position in the aligned book, make an rsdata file.

    dalvec:
    Convert the rsdata file into a symvec file, which the next program
    can use to make the logo.

    ri:
    The program determines the individual informations of the sites in the book
    as aligned by the instructions, according to the frequency table given in
    the rsdata file.  The program calculates the Ri(b,l) table:

        Ri(b,l) := 2 - (- log2( f(b,l)))

    and sums this up for each sequence.  Ri is defined so that the average of
    the Ri's for a set of sequences is Rsequence.

    makelogo:
    Finally! Make the sequence logo!

Useful Python scripts not in pipeline 
-------------------------------------

    filter_sites.py 

    Not part of the pipeline, but can be used prior to running delila_pipeline.py
    to remove overlapping sites.

    To Run:

    filter_sites.py -f <site_file.txt> -n <int>

    Remove sites with x number of bases overlap, file MUST BE SORTED.

    arguments:
    -h, --help     Show this help message and exit
    -f, --file     Text file, containing sites
    -n, --number   Number of base overlap, default(15)


    define_site_position.py

    filter_Sites.py -f <site_file.txt> -n <int>

    Read sites file line by line.  Parse each line and shift
    the position by +/- value taking account of the strand.
            
    arguments:
    -h, --help      show this help message and exit
    -f , --file     Text file, containing sites
    -n , --number   Number of base to shift (negative = upstream)

    example input file:

        NC_007488.2     RSP_4039_1700   forward 1700
        NC_007488.2     RSP_4038_2627   forward 2627

    usage:

        define_site_position.py -f input.txt -n -10  

        This results in a site file of the same format as the input.
        All sites shifted upstream by 10 bases.

        alternatively:

        define_site_position.py -f input.txt -n 10

        This results in a site file of the same format as the input.
        All sites shifted downstream by 10 bases.
