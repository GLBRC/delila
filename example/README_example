This directory contains an example use case for running delila_pipeline.py

Input files:
    
    1) Rsphaeroides_GenBank.gbff
    2) Location_File_Example.txt

    Set Left = -10 and Right = +10 

    command:

    delila_pipeline.py -g Rsphaeroides_GenBank.gbff -s Location_File_Example.txt  -l -10 -r +10 

    This will produce 2 logo files:

    R.sphaeroides-2.4.1-initial.logo.pdf   -- logo prior to filter sites with no information
    R.sphaeroides-2.4.1-FINAL.logo.pdf     -- Final logo, the height of the nucleotides is higher
                                              than the initial logo, indicating the removal of
                                              low information sites.
